# Django-Post-Site
Made for learning purpose.<br> Anyone can view posts at home page. But if someone want to make a new post, have to register and login.<br>
Posts can have one image. Someone can change it's own password from profile page. Moderator users and admin(superuser) can ban and remove ban normal users
(For this feature look mod's/admin's profile page. Can go by top right nav bar, user's name).
Banned users can't post. Normal users can delete own posts, mods and admin can delete anyones post.
